JarvisTrade Full-Stack Study Guide & Mastery Roadmap

========================================================
1. Project Purpose & High-Level Architecture
========================================================

**Purpose:**  
JarvisTrade is a marketplace for premium trading tools and freelance services, featuring digital product sales, project management, payment processing, licensing, and a blog. It uses a FastAPI backend (Python) and a React/Next.js frontend (TypeScript).

**Architecture Overview:**

[User] <---> [React Frontend] <--REST API--> [FastAPI Backend] <---> [Database]
                                                    |
                                         [Payment Providers (Paystack, MQL5)]
                                                    |
                                         [Email Service, File Storage]

**Key Flows:**
- Users browse products, purchase via Paystack/MQL5, receive licenses, and download files.
- Freelance project requests are managed with admin/client dashboards.
- Notifications and emails keep users informed.

**Diagram (Pseudo):**

```
[User] <-> [Frontend] <-> [API] <-> [DB]
                          |
                  [Payment Service]
                          |
                  [Email/Notification]
```

========================================================
2. Codebase Modules & Their Roles
========================================================

**Backend (FastAPI):**
- `main.py`: Main API, routes, business logic, orchestration.
- `auth.py`: Authentication (JWT, password hashing, user session).
- `models.py`: SQLAlchemy ORM models (User, Product, Transaction, etc.).
- `schemas.py`: Pydantic schemas for request/response validation.
- `database.py`: DB connection/session management.
- `payment_service.py`: Paystack/MQL5 integration, payment verification.
- `email_service.py`: Email sending logic.
- `license_encryption.py`: License file generation and validation.
- Migration scripts: DB schema evolution.

**Frontend (React/Next.js):**
- `src/components/`: UI components (ProductCard, ProjectManagementAdmin, etc.).
- `src/pages/`: Page-level components (Marketplace, About, TermsOfService, etc.).
- `src/services/`: API client logic.
- `src/types/`: TypeScript types.
- `public/`: Static assets.

**Design Patterns:**
- Dependency Injection (FastAPI's Depends)
- MVC-like separation (models, schemas, routes)
- Service Layer (payment_service, email_service)
- Modular React components

========================================================
3. Key Files & Functions for "Big Picture"
========================================================

**Backend:**
- `main.py`: Start here. Study the API endpoints, especially `/api/checkout`, `/api/payment/verify`, `/api/webhook/paystack`, `/api/products`, `/api/project-requests`.
- `auth.py`: Understand `create_access_token`, `verify_token`, `get_current_user`.
- `models.py`: Review all ORM models to see the data structure.
- `payment_service.py`: See how payments are initialized and verified.
- `email_service.py`: How notifications/emails are sent.

**Frontend:**
- `src/components/ProjectManagementAdmin.tsx`: Admin dashboard logic.
- `src/pages/Marketplace.tsx`, `src/pages/About.tsx`: User-facing flows.
- `src/services/api.ts`: How frontend talks to backend.

========================================================
4. Why This Structure? Trade-offs & Choices
========================================================

- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  Backend is modular—auth, payment, notifications, and business logic are separated for maintainability.
- **Scalability:**  
  FastAPI supports async endpoints and dependency injection, making it scalable and testable.
- **Security:**  
  JWT for stateless auth, environment variables for secrets, and payment handled by third parties (PCI compliance).
- **Frontend Modularity:**  
  React components are reusable and organized by function, making UI changes isolated and testable.

**Trade-offs:**
- Some business logic is in routes (could be further abstracted).
- Print/debug statements in production code (should be replaced with logging).
- Payment retry and webhook flows are robust but could use more idempotency and security hardening.

========================================================
5. Practical Exercises (per Major Concept)
========================================================

**A. Authentication & User Management**
- Exercise: Add a "reset password" endpoint and UI.
- Exercise: Refactor `verify_token` to remove print statements and use logging.
- Reflect: How does JWT improve scalability over session-based auth?

**B. Product & Order Management**
- Exercise: Add a new product category and display it in the frontend.
- Exercise: Write a test that simulates a user purchasing and downloading a product.
- Reflect: How does the system ensure only buyers can download products?

**C. Payment Integration**
- Exercise: Implement webhook signature verification for Paystack.
- Exercise: Add a new payment provider (e.g., Stripe) as a learning project.
- Reflect: What are the risks if payment amounts are not validated server-side?

**D. Project Management (Freelance Services)**
- Exercise: Add a new status to project requests (e.g., "On Hold") and update the admin dashboard to use it.
- Exercise: Write a script to seed the database with sample projects and responses.
- Reflect: How does the system prevent unauthorized access to project files?

**E. Notifications & Email**
- Exercise: Add a new notification type (e.g., "promotion") and send it to all users.
- Exercise: Refactor notification creation to use async email sending.
- Reflect: Why are notification preferences stored as JSON?

**F. Frontend Integration**
- Exercise: Add a loading spinner to the checkout page.
- Exercise: Refactor a component to use React hooks for state management.
- Reflect: How does the frontend handle payment status polling?

========================================================
6. Reflective Questions (After Each Section)
========================================================

- What is the flow of data from user action to database update for a purchase?
- How does the backend ensure only authorized users can access certain endpoints?
- What would break if the payment webhook was not called?
- How are errors surfaced to the user, and how could this be improved?
- Where is business logic duplicated, and how could it be centralized?

========================================================
7. Weak Spots & Learning Projects
========================================================

- **Logging:** Replace all print/debug with structured logging (e.g., Python’s `logging` module).
- **Testing:** Add automated tests for payment, download, and project management flows.
- **Security:** Harden webhook endpoints, validate all user input, and review CORS settings.
- **Performance:** Profile endpoints for slow queries; add caching for frequently accessed data.
- **Documentation:** Expand inline docstrings and add OpenAPI docs for all endpoints.
- **Frontend:** Add error boundaries and improve user feedback for failed actions.

**Learning Project Ideas:**
- Add a Stripe payment integration.
- Build a dashboard for admin analytics (orders, revenue, user growth).
- Implement a full-text search for products and blog posts.
- Add multi-language support to the frontend.

========================================================
8. Mastery Project: "End-to-End Feature Build"
========================================================

**Challenge:**  
Design and implement a new feature: "Gift a Product"

**Requirements:**
- Allow users to purchase a product as a gift for another user (by email).
- On successful payment, generate a license and send an email to the recipient.
- Add admin dashboard support to track gifted purchases.
- Update the frontend to support gifting in the checkout flow.
- Write backend and frontend tests for the new flow.

**Steps:**
1. Design the database changes (e.g., add a `gifted_to_email` field to transactions/licenses).
2. Update checkout and payment logic to handle gifting.
3. Implement email notification to the recipient.
4. Add admin and user dashboard views for gifted products.
5. Test the entire flow, including edge cases (recipient not registered, failed payment, etc.).

**Reflection:**  
Document your design decisions, trade-offs, and what you learned. Present your solution as if onboarding a new developer.

========================================================

1. Read this guide fully for orientation.
2. Study `main.py` and `auth.py` for API and authentication flows.
3. Explore `models.py` and `schemas.py` to understand data structures.
4. Review payment and notification services.
5. Dive into the React frontend, focusing on checkout and project management.
6. Complete practical exercises and answer reflective questions.
